I have completed all major parts of the implementation strategy.

I did find a slight problem with two of the tests, which are the
two concerning data5.in. It appears that data5.in has some
characters that causes the program to not read it at all.
Thus, the program runs as if it didn't read said file.

I have tested the program with java on my own computer rather
than the Unix timeshare and while it reads in the test file fine
on my computer, the exact same program doesn't act the same on
the Unix timeshare. Taking away such characters from the test
file does solve this problem. I did also find a few classmates
with the same problem. Hopefully, this will not cost us any points.
