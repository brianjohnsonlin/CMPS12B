I had a problem I could not fix with array doubling. When I attempt
to free the old array, the program aborts. It runs fine if I do not
attempt to free the array. However, this will cause leaks. Because
the problem is contained within the array doubling function, the
program runs fine without array doubling (although the program will
run noticeably slower). So in the end, I had to choose between
losing points for not doubling the array or risk losing points for
memory leaks.
Ultimately I chose risking point loss for memory leaks because
there are only 2 leaked blocks in test 7 which is less than the 4
it would take for me to lose points.
I hope you take this into consideration when grading.
