Grader will copy this scoresheet into the student's submit
directory.  Also copy in the mk script.

Run the script mk before grading.

Student's name: ______________

In the table below, the numbers in parens are the maximum score
for consideration.  If the assignment is worth less than that
amount, enter a negative score to deduct points.  Enter the
negative number at the beginning of the line.  Comment as to why
the point was deducted.

Copy files from the .score directory to the student's submit
directory then run the script:
.     mk

For each of the point ranges given, assign 0 points to mean not
done at all, full points meaning all done, and partial credit
for partially done.  Within each section, you may not assign a
negative score.
