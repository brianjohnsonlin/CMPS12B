hello.java and Makefile were copied from the hidden .files directory in the lab folder.
I used WinSCP to view and transfer files. There is also a command terminal, but many commands don't work such as "bash" and "cid", so I use PuTTY for the command terminal and WinSCP for file viewing.
I also use JCreator for programming.
